# Cloud-Computing

Welcome to the Cloud Computing repository. Here, teachers can share curriculum and resources. Below you will find links to files within the repository as well as external websites. 

Within the repository you will find most shared resources in the [Resources folder](./Resources/), which is broken down into files for individual Units. For now, the [Standards document](./Resources/STANDARDS.md) contains links to relevant resources. Once a common sequence of units has been designed and decided upon, you will find documents for those units in the Resources folder as well.
